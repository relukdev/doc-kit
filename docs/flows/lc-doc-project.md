    [*] --> Configured : User answers config
    Configured --> Analyzing : Step 2 starts
    Analyzing --> Generating : Analysis complete
    Generating --> Exporting : All docs written
    Exporting --> Deployed : Build passes
    Exporting --> Generating : Build fails
    Deployed --> [*]
```

**Lifecycle summary:** A documentation project begins when the user provides configuration. It moves through analysis, generation, and export phases. If the Astro build fails, it returns to generation for fixes. Successfully built projects are deployed.

## Transition Table

| From | To | Trigger | Condition |
|------|----|---------|-----------|
| Start | Configured | User answers 10 config questions | All required fields provided |
| Configured | Analyzing | SKILL.md starts Step 2 | Valid project path |
| Analyzing | Generating | analysis.md written | Codebase scanned successfully |
| Generating | Exporting | All doc files created | Frontmatter valid on all files |
| Exporting | Deployed | `npm run build` passes | Exit code 0 |
| Exporting | Generating | Build fails | Missing title, broken links |

## State Details

| State | Description | Duration |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Configured | User input gathered, ready to analyze | Seconds |
| Analyzing | Scanning codebase structure | 1–3 minutes |
| Generating | Writing all documentation files | 5–15 minutes |
| Exporting | Building Astro site or organizing Markdown | 1–2 minutes |
| Deployed | Site live and accessible | Persistent |
