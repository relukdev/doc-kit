# DocKit Master Documentation

> **Quick Reference**
> - **Project**: DocKit Master — Knowledge Systematization Engine
> - **Version**: 1.0
> - **Skills**: 11 | **Workflows**: 5 | **IDE Adapters**: 6
> - **Generated**: 2026-02-28

Welcome to the DocKit Master documentation — generated by DocKit Master itself as a showcase of its capabilities. One codebase scan produced this entire knowledge base: personas, jobs-to-be-done, process flows, technical architecture, user guides, and API reference.

## Knowledge Foundation

Understanding who uses the system and why — the foundation for all documentation.

- [Personas](./personas/) — 3 User Personas + 1 Buyer Persona
- [Jobs To Be Done](./jtbd/) — 3 Main Jobs with full JTBD canvases
- [Process Flows](./flows/) — Workflows, sequences, lifecycles, journeys

## Technical Documentation

Architecture, data model, deployment, and data flow.

- [System Architecture](./architecture) — Component diagram, ADRs
- [Data Model](./database) — File-based schema and entities
- [Deployment Guide](./deployment) — Installation, hosting, CI/CD
- [Data Flow](./data-flow) — Pipeline transformation diagrams

## User Guides (SOPs)

Step-by-step instructions enriched with persona context and JTBD alignment.

- [User Guides Overview](./sop/) — Guide index by persona
- [Using the CLI](./sop/using-cli) — Generate prompts interactively
- [Generating Tech Docs](./sop/generating-tech-docs) — Architecture and database docs
- [Generating SOP Guides](./sop/generating-sop-guides) — Knowledge-enriched user guides
- [Customizing Templates](./sop/customizing-templates) — Theme and CSS customization

## Skill API Reference

Interface documentation for each skill file — inputs, outputs, and rules.

- [API Overview](./api/) — Skill dependency graph
- [analyze-codebase](./api/analyze-codebase) — Codebase scanning interface
- [content-guidelines](./api/content-guidelines) — Formatting and quality rules
- [Orchestrator (SKILL.md)](./api/orchestrator) — Pipeline routing logic
