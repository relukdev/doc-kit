# Tech Lead Taylor — Buyer Persona

> **Quick Reference**
> - **JTBD**: Systematize team knowledge to reduce onboarding time and prevent knowledge loss
> - **Buyer Type**: Decision Maker
> - **Purchase Involvement**: Evaluator + Approver

## Summary

> Tech Lead Taylor manages 5–15 developers across multiple projects. They have experienced the pain of losing critical knowledge when senior engineers leave, and spend 20% of their time answering the same architecture questions from new hires. They evaluate tools that automate documentation generation directly from code — with zero extra effort from developers.

## Job To Be Done

**Systematize team knowledge to reduce onboarding friction and prevent institutional knowledge loss.**

## Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Potential Titles** | CTO / VP Engineering / Tech Lead / Engineering Manager |
| **Reports To** | CEO / VP Product |
| **Team Managed** | 5–15 developers, 1–2 PMs |
| **Budget Authority** | Direct (tools under $500/mo) |

## Motivations

- Zero-effort documentation — generated from code, no manual writing
- Consistent quality — every project gets the same documentation standard
- Multi-IDE support — works with whatever IDE each developer prefers

## Biggest Challenges

- Knowledge silos — critical knowledge lives in heads, not in docs
- Documentation decay — docs become stale weeks after creation
- Onboarding cost — new hires take 2–4 weeks to become productive

## Decision Criteria

| Priority | Criteria | Weight |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Zero developer effort (AI does the work) | Critical |
| 2 | Works with existing IDE (no context switch) | Critical |
| 3 | Output quality (SEO, search, diagrams) | Important |
| 4 | Self-hosted (no vendor lock-in) | Important |
| 5 | Multi-language support | Nice-to-have |

## Key Messaging

- "1 scan = complete knowledge base — Personas, JTBD, architecture, SOPs, all from code"
- "Works in 7 AI IDEs — install once, use everywhere"
- "AI-generated docs that are both SEO-optimized and LLM-readable"
